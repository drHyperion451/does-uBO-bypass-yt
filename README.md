# Are youtube ADS blocked by uBlock?

This website will tell you if you should upgrade the ublock filters or not. 

## How it works?
It just compares the latest filter made by [ublock volunteers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenhawk8054/misc/main/yt-fix.txt) with [youtube anti-adbock script](https://pastefy.app/G1Txv5su/raw). If they matches it means the filter is updated. 

## How can I contribute?
Fork the `dev` branch, make some changes and PR to the `dev` branch to avoid overloading github pages deployment.

## Donations?
I do not accept donations. This proyect has the same philosophy as the ublock proyect. Also will have no ads.
